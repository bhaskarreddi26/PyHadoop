**Flight Data Analysis using Spark GraphX**

Problem Statement: To analyze Real-Time Flight data using Spark GraphX, provide near real-time computation results and visualize the results using Google Data Studio.

**Use Case â€“ Computations to be done:**

* Compute the total number of flight routes
* Compute and sort the longest flight routes
* Display the airport with the highest degree vertex
* List the most important airports according to PageRank
* List the routes with the lowest flight costs

We will use Spark GraphX for the above computations and visualize the results using Google Data Studio.
