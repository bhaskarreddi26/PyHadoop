**Flight Data Analysis using Spark GraphX**

Problem Statement: To analyze Real-Time Flight data using Spark GraphX, provide near real-time computation results and visualize the results using Google Data Studio.

Use Case â€“ Computations to be done:

Compute the total number of flight routes
Compute and sort the longest flight routes
Display the airport with the highest degree vertex
List the most important airports according to PageRank
List the routes with the lowest flight costs
We will use Spark GraphX for the above computations and visualize the results using Google Data Studio.
