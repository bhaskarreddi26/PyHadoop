- ML Algorithms: common learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering
- Featurization: feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection
- Pipelines: tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines
- Persistence: saving and load algorithms, models, and Pipelines
- Utilities: linear algebra, statistics, data handling, etc.

> **Note : As of Spark 2.0, the RDD-based APIs in the spark.mllib package have entered maintenance mode. The primary Machine Learning API for Spark is now the DataFrame-based API in the spark.ml package.**


What is “Spark ML”?

“Spark ML” is not an official name but occasionally used to refer to the MLlib DataFrame-based API. This is majorly due to the org.apache.spark.ml Scala package name used by the DataFrame-based API, and the “Spark ML Pipelines” term we used initially to emphasize the pipeline concept.
