- ML Algorithms: common learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering
- Featurization: feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection
- Pipelines: tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines
- Persistence: saving and load algorithms, models, and Pipelines
- Utilities: linear algebra, statistics, data handling, etc.

> **Note : As of Spark 2.0, the RDD-based APIs in the spark.mllib package have entered maintenance mode. The primary Machine Learning API for Spark is now the DataFrame-based API in the spark.ml package.**
