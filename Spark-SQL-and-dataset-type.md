A Dataset is a strongly-typed, immutable collection of objects that are mapped to a relational schema.  At the core of the Dataset API is a new concept called an encoder, which is responsible for converting between JVM objects and tabular representation. The tabular representation is stored using Sparkâ€™s internal Tungsten binary format, allowing for operations on serialized data and improved memory utilization.  Spark 1.6 comes with support for automatically generating encoders for a wide variety of types, including primitive types (e.g. String, Integer, Long), Scala case classes, and Java Beans.

Spark has built-in support for automatically generating encoders for primitive types (e.g. String, Integer, Long), Scala case classes, and Java Beans.
