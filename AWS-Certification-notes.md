Those are my personal notes on AWS Solution Architect certification preparation. Hope you find them usefull.

To pass AWS certification, you should have:

Sound knowledge about most of the AWS services ( EC2, VPC, RDS, Cloudfront, S3, Route53 etc,)
Hands on experience with AWS services.
Good knowledge of disaster recovery, security and High availability architectures.
If you do not have prior hands-on experience and knowledge or you have little knowledge about AWS services, it is better to take an online course. If you already have experience in architecting solutions on AWS it is not necessary to take an online course.
